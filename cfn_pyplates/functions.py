"""Python wrappers for CloudFormation intrinsic functions

These are all available without preamble in a pyplate's global namespace.

These help make the pyplate look a little more like python than JSON, and can
be ignored if you want to write the raw JSON directly. (But you don't want
that, right? After all, that's why you're using pyplates.)

Notes:

* All "Return" values are a little midleading, in that what really gets
  returned is the JSON-ified CFN intrinsic function. When using these in
  pyplates, though, it's probably easiest to forget that and only be
  concerned with how CFN will handle this, hence the Return values.
* To avoid the issue of using the wrong types with functions that take
  sequences as input (join, select), argument unpacking is used. Therefore,
  pass the sequence elements one at a time, rather than the sequence itself,
  after passing the separator (for join) or index (for select).
* Using CloudFormation's Join function versus a pythonic 'string'.join
  allows you to use CFN's intrinsic functions inside a join statement. The
  pythonic string join method may literally interpret a call to an intrinsic
  function, causing the resulting JSON to be interpreted as a string and
  ignored by the CloudFormation template parser
* Functions related to conditions tend to overlap with python keywords, so they
  are prefixed with ``c_`` to differentiate them (so, Fn::And become ``c_and``)

.. note:
    Documentation for the functions is verbatim from the AWS Docs,
    except where identifiers are changed to fit with normal python style.
