MetaMetrics, Inc
----------------

The original development of this library was to streamline the deployment
process at MetaMetrics. We've been using pyplates for a while now, and we
always intended to get it out for others to use once we were able to make
the time. Normally, that means that it would never get done.

MetaMetrics deserves special thanks for not just allowing this to be shared,
but actively encouraging it publishing. If that sounds like a good place to
work, that's because it *is* a good place to work.
